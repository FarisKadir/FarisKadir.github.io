                    <p>
                            Originally I am from Trinidad and Tobago, however I spent most of my life in the United States. I moved to Queens, New York when I was 6 years old. My family and I then migrated to South Florida in 1998. I spent the rest of my life there until 5 months ago, when my wife and I moved to Winter Garden.

                <h2>Professional Background</h2>
                    <p>I started on my career path when I was 28 years old. I landed a technical support job for a startup software company that made an electronic medical record software for gastroenterologist. During my time here I spent many hours shadowing / harassing my tier 3 support leads. This led me to learning more about relational databases, vmware and a load of other information on network infrastructure. With my experience in this niche market I was able to land a better paying job with a large physician management group. I worked there for 2 years, specializing in creating healthcare interfaces. These interfaces pulled data in from organizations such as lab corp, quest, etc. and then inputted that data into my company's database.
